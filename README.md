# What is this?
**The Preventive Structure Philosophy Framework** can be freely modified within the scope of the MIT License to create your own personalized framework.

# What you can do
We sometimes make choices that lack long-term perspective or are unethical. Being monitored by someone else to act ethically violates your freedom.

However, by modifying this HTML file to create your own framework, you can assist yourself in your own thinking process. Since frameworks provide guidelines, they always give the same answers. Therefore, unlike AI, there is no possibility of making mistakes. Of course, you need to think according to the situation, so we do not recommend treating the framework as absolute.

# Background Philosophy
We have structured the awareness and avoidance of risks. Through simple questions for confirmation, there is a possibility of maintaining rational, ethical, and long-term perspectives. I prioritized implementing philosophy and making ethics, including AI ethics, something we can tangibly experience. It is completed as a static HTML file and runs in a local environment.
